description: Use subagents to gather context, then ask clarifying questions
---
<!-- Adapted from pi-subagents/prompts/gather-context-and-clarify.md — IPC and worktree references removed. -->

Based on our discussion and my intent, launch focused context-gathering subagents before planning or implementing.

Use scout to inspect the relevant local files, existing patterns, constraints, tests, and likely integration points. Use researcher when external docs, recent sources, ecosystem context, or primary evidence would improve the answer.

Give each subagent a specific meta prompt. Ask them to return concise findings plus the remaining clarification questions that matter for implementation confidence.

After they return, synthesize what we know and use ask_user_question to ask me the unresolved questions needed to reach a shared understanding.
